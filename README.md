This is a simple breakout board for the eByte E73 module with nrf52832
microcontroller.  This board requires minimal parts, in fact it can
work with only the module and no other parts.

Add buttons and LEDs if you need, and there is space for two QWIIC
(I2C) sockets.

The board can be used with Arduino (Sandeep Mistry's nrf port with the
generic nrf52 target), or with Micro Python or Zephyr OS using the
included board definitions.

The circuit board files (for KiCad 5) are included.
